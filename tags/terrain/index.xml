      <description>What kind of knives do you guys use for slicing your procedural voxel terrain? When I slice with a serrated bread knife I get all these little blocks on the edges.
(Above is a joke.)
Terrain generated with only 3 density functions clipped at 4x4 sectors. #screenshotsaturday
OK, one more shitpost while taking a sick day.

      <description>Update: Screenshots with realistic sized trees on same terrain, and fixed some links. :3
 Tree scale now in 10-20m range

I noticed r/proceduralgeneration has a lot activity lately, so I thought I would do quick post on how I&amp;rsquo;m generating my current test islands with only 4 functions. This is what they typically look like:

      <description>Well, mostly focused on non-renderer stuff this weekend like bringing more of the web editor interface into in-game viewport UI. A few minor improvements to sky with a simple per fragment Preetham, and ported all my shaders to the updated Kagura shader lang to get ready for Vulkan.
                  Same scene with different foliage seeds and lighting &amp;nbsp;  Below is a simple test for tiling fbm independently for foliage generation with the threaded voxel sectors, so there is no need to do another physics based ray cast pass.</description>

      <description>Getting tired of pure voxel terrain again, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to move voxel system to more of a detail terrain painting system. GPU Clipmaps are cool again, and much more flexible when it comes to foliage deco &amp;ndash; so hopefully this will be the last ugly terrain screenshot. Making the system to generate foliage with raycasts as seen in ye old island demo as fun for programmer art, however for deco painting artists don&amp;rsquo;t like that kind of thing.</description>

      <title>Terrain and Biomes and Flora oh my</title>

      <description>So I dusted off the terrain / biome system to hook it up to the voxel terrain system, since it makes a lot more sense to model very large landmasses in a way people can understand. Density functions by parts isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad thing, but even if you expose this with a UI flow graph &amp;ndash; who the fuck is going to understand it that also wants to use a flow graph chart?</description>

      <description>Got the basic voxel terrain in today. The most time was spent on new ways to generate and enqueue Voxels, RenderMesh, PhysicsMesh in various worker threads and sync them amongst all the subsystems. Also refactored some of the math library and noise generation while in there to avoid overlap.
 Voxel Terrain Sectors 2x1x2
The scale of this image required me to adjust my camera&amp;hellip; typical player could be about as big as a pixel here&amp;hellip; going to hook this up to my biome and erosion simulation next.</description>

      <title>Isosurface Extraction done quick</title>

      <description>Cross post from Google+:
Voxels and Triplanar Mapping only took a day and a half thanks to the excellent docs from Nvidia and my awesome little engine that could. Going to work in real-time editing and maybe tessellation guided by isosurface extraction later if I don&amp;rsquo;t get sidetracked with other big features. This is a CPU converted isosurface to standard mesh to use the CPU side physics. eg voxels -&amp;gt; mesh.</description>
