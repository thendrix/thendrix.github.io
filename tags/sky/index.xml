      <description>Horizon Zero Dawn style image based ecotope placement may became default for alpha. This means the old 3d density functions + physics based placement will be replaced with heightmap + image-based proc gen for &amp;ldquo;large scale&amp;rdquo; features and placement. These maps can be fed directly into the voxel/SDF systems as input as well.
This makes it easier to generate thousands of islands and put stuff on them basically with more realism.</description>

      <description>Quite a bit has changed as we move towards alpha. This post will mostly deal with environmental rendering changes. This means you won&amp;rsquo;t see any of my character or weapon art for this post. Basically, all the prototypes are being generalized and systems are being merged and replaced for the best trade offs. This also means Low/Med/High graphics quality levels are being roughed out. All images here are from a GTX 1080 Ti running on Ubuntu 20.</description>
