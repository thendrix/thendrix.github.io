      <description>Testing out using hugo for blogging. I was going to bring over some old blog posts to here, but decided it might be better to update those posts and roll them out later.
Today I&amp;rsquo;ll just link to the video of the transient material instance (MI) system that was put in not long ago. This system allows every object to have it&amp;rsquo;s own procedurally generated MI to handle various parameters of VFX materials such as volume, colors, patterns.</description>

      <description>WIP Character Creator/Appearance system for my engine/game. You can adjust skin tone/paint colors, -/+ various body parts and sizes. The video is of my favorite player race, but there are others. 100% developed and ran in Linux. ;)

      <description>Late entry for #screenshotsaturday really basic flickering stars that may not show up on video lol. I&amp;rsquo;m looking into using an actual star map to navigate by in game later on&amp;hellip; This is more of a mood test while a had a couple of hours.
  Maybe you can see them in images:

      <description>This page has some tweets + imgur posts combined here related to first posts of WIP RPG. These were some of the media tests done for social media video uploads. Using these to test video via hugo now.
WIP RPG showing scale of a &amp;ldquo;small&amp;rdquo; 8x8 island. SDF proxy shadows and other &amp;ldquo;far&amp;rdquo; LoDs only for now. I had to crop out 1080p from the 2k image to record for now, sorry.</description>

      <description>Back to my take on OrenNayar/Beckmann (needs better energy conservation) Player Hus generation from floor plans (line art,multi-floor) New attachment system replaces all use of old one No work on hybrid shadows yet  #screenshotsaturday

Yeah, the mage with horns is using the Burley with GGX I tried for a bit and tossed. I like the highlights of my old 2-pass better but needs work to avoid getting too hot.</description>

      <description>Hey guys, let me do the talking &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m sure this shop keeper will want to covert. Nothing like last time.

      <description>Update: Screenshots with realistic sized trees on same terrain, and fixed some links. :3
 Tree scale now in 10-20m range

I noticed r/proceduralgeneration has a lot activity lately, so I thought I would do quick post on how I&amp;rsquo;m generating my current test islands with only 4 functions. This is what they typically look like:

      <description>Well, mostly focused on non-renderer stuff this weekend like bringing more of the web editor interface into in-game viewport UI. A few minor improvements to sky with a simple per fragment Preetham, and ported all my shaders to the updated Kagura shader lang to get ready for Vulkan.

      <description>Getting tired of pure voxel terrain again, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to move voxel system to more of a detail terrain painting system. GPU Clipmaps are cool again, and much more flexible when it comes to foliage deco &amp;ndash; so hopefully this will be the last ugly terrain screenshot. Making the system to generate foliage with raycasts as seen in ye old island demo as fun for programmer art, however for deco painting artists don&amp;rsquo;t like that kind of thing.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll a une règle comme quoi tout répertoire qui ne commence pas par &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; sera
copié tel-quel dans le répertoire &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt;. Hugo garde tout le contenu statique
dans le répertoire &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;. Vous devez donc déplacer tout ce type de contenu
là-dedans. Avec Jekylll, l&amp;rsquo;arborescence ressemblant à ceci :&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Terrain and Biomes and Flora oh my</title>

      <description>So I dusted off the terrain / biome system to hook it up to the voxel terrain system, since it makes a lot more sense to model very large landmasses in a way people can understand. Density functions by parts isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad thing, but even if you expose this with a UI flow graph &amp;ndash; who the fuck is going to understand it that also wants to use a flow graph chart?</description>

      <description>Got the basic voxel terrain in today. The most time was spent on new ways to generate and enqueue Voxels, RenderMesh, PhysicsMesh in various worker threads and sync them amongst all the subsystems. Also refactored some of the math library and noise generation while in there to avoid overlap.
 Voxel Terrain Sectors 2x1x2
The scale of this image required me to adjust my camera&amp;hellip; typical player could be about as big as a pixel here&amp;hellip; going to hook this up to my biome and erosion simulation next.</description>

      <title>Isosurface Extraction done quick</title>

      <description>Cross post from Google+:
Voxels and Triplanar Mapping only took a day and a half thanks to the excellent docs from Nvidia and my awesome little engine that could. Going to work in real-time editing and maybe tessellation guided by isosurface extraction later if I don&amp;rsquo;t get sidetracked with other big features. This is a CPU converted isosurface to standard mesh to use the CPU side physics. eg voxels -&amp;gt; mesh.</description>
