            <description>Testing out using hugo for blogging. I was going to bring over some old blog posts to here, but decided it might be better to update those posts and roll them out later.
Today I&amp;rsquo;ll just link to the video of the transient material instance (MI) system that was put in not long ago. This system allows every object to have it&amp;rsquo;s own procedurally generated MI to handle various parameters of VFX materials such as volume, colors, patterns.</description>

<p>Today I&rsquo;ll just link to the video of the transient material instance (MI) system that was put in not long ago.  This system allows every object to have it&rsquo;s own procedurally generated MI to handle various parameters of VFX materials such as volume, colors, patterns.  All of the fluids in the video are using the same shader/material.</p>
